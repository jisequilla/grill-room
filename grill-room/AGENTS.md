# Chat — Agent Guide

Chat is the minimal chat-first agent-native app. The public root is a marketing
surface; the authenticated chat app starts at `/home`. Actions carry the real
capabilities, and screens exist only where a workflow needs durable UI around
the conversation.

## Skills

The default app skill surface is intentionally small. Promotion, learning,
translation, changelog, provider, and release workflows are optional; enable
the matching skill only when this app actually uses that workflow. The
`docs-search` action reads the version-matched framework docs bundled with
  `@agent-native/core`; `source-search` reads core and first-party template
  implementations. Prefer both over memory when package APIs, actions, or agent
  surfaces are involved.

## Core Rules

- UI feedback: target 100 ms, never exceed 400 ms; acknowledge before network work.
- Follow the root framework contract: data in SQL, actions first, application
  state for navigation/selection, and shared agent chat for AI work.
- Store large file/blob payloads in configured file/blob storage, not SQL: no
  base64, `data:` URLs, images, video/audio, PDFs, ZIPs, screenshots,
  thumbnails, or replay chunks in app tables, `application_state`, `settings`,
  or `resources`; persist URLs, ids, or handles instead.
- Never hardcode API keys, tokens, webhook URLs, signing secrets, private
  Builder/internal data, customer data, or credential-looking literals. Use
  secrets/OAuth/runtime configuration and obvious placeholders in examples.
- For external integrations, inspect the workspace/provider connection catalog
  first. Reuse an existing connection and its scoped credential resolver; only
  use app-local vault/OAuth/settings primitives when no reusable connection
  exists. Keep custom setup UI provider-specific and never duplicate storage.
- Keep actions deterministic and focused. Research, analysis, generation,
  recommendation, and synthesis start in the AgentSidebar and let the agent
  orchestrate its tools; follow-ups stay in the same thread rather than moving
  the user to a second freeform prompt box.
- Never fabricate. If an action fails or data is missing, say so and recover
  instead of inventing a result or claiming success.
- Verify a write before reporting it done — re-read the row or the screen.
- Use `view-screen` or application state when the active page/selection is
  unclear.

For a custom app, keep `server/plugins/config.ts` aligned with the product
brand. Its `app.name` is used in transactional emails, and its optional
`app.logoUrl` can point to an absolute HTTPS logo URL.

## Actions

The app's capabilities, in `actions/`. Reads are GET actions; the rest mutate.

| Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `create-session` | Start a grilling session from a loose idea, defaulting the interviewer model to the global default. |
| `list-sessions` | Every session with its title, state, and last activity, most recently active first. |
| `get-session` | One session by id, so resuming lands where it left off. |
| `delete-session` | A session and everything under it: decisions, history, rounds, spec, tickets, build records. |
| `set-session-answering-mode` | Switch a session between whole-round and one-at-a-time answering. |
| `get-default-model` | The global default interviewer model new sessions pre-fill with; `fable` when unset. |
| `set-default-model` | Set that default. |
| `get-setting` / `set-setting` | Read and write one app-wide setting. |
| `get-tree` | A session's whole design tree: every decision, what it depends on, its answer, its previous answers with the interviewer's reason for superseding each, and its derived state. |
| `get-current-round` | The round a session is answering, with each card's question, recommendation, derived state, and saved draft — plus the session's state, its done-proposal summary when it has one, and whether the interviewer is working, idle, or failed. |
| `list-rounds` | Every round of a session in order, with the questions asked and the answers given. |
| `request-next-round` | Review whatever a reopened answer put in doubt, then ask the interviewer for the next round, validate the proposal against the tree — including a done proposal, accepted only once nothing would still be asked — and open the round. A session that had proposed or confirmed done returns to interviewing the moment a round actually opens. |
| `save-draft-answer` | Save one card's draft answer — accepted recommendation, own answer, or a steering move (unknown, pushed back, deferred, prototype flagged) — so a half-answered round survives a reload. |
| `submit-round` | Settle an open round's decisions (a steering move does not settle its decision) and ask for the next round. Refuses a round with unanswered cards. |
| `reopen-decision` | Reopen a settled decision: its answer becomes history, it is asked again straight away, and everything under it goes stale until the interviewer reconfirms or re-asks it. Returns a done-proposed or confirmed session to interviewing and clears the done summary; leaving `confirmed` also marks the session's spec not current. |
| `add-decision` | Add a decision the user thought of themselves; it awaits the interviewer's placement in the tree. Returns a done-proposed or confirmed session to interviewing and clears the done summary. |
| `answer-decision` | Give a real answer to an unresolved loose end (unknown, deferred, prototype flagged, or an unanswered push back) outside a round, without calling the interviewer. Call `request-next-round` afterwards: that is where a reopened decision's dependents are reviewed. |
| `list-loose-ends` | Every decision blocking confirmation of a session — unknown, deferred, prototype flagged or pushed back and not withdrawn, stale, unplaced, or never answered — each with a reason naming its category. Empty once nothing blocks confirming. |
| `disposition-decision` | Resolve a loose end by moving it out of scope or into the notes as a named open question, instead of a real answer. Settles the decision (as dispositioned) without calling the interviewer; refuses a decision that is not a loose end, or one that is stale or unplaced. |
| `confirm-session` | Confirm a session whose done proposal is pending. Refuses outside `done-proposed`, refuses with the list of loose ends while any remain, and refuses while a turn is working. |
| `navigate` | Move the UI to a view or path, through application state. |
| `view-screen` | What the user is looking at. Call it first when the visible context matters. |
| `provider-api-request` | Call Slack's Web API through the workspace connection. |

`request-next-round` and `submit-round` both wait on a Claude CLI turn, which
takes about a minute and can take several. The client action hooks time out at
60 s by default, so UI code calling either one must pass a `timeoutMs` of
several minutes; the default cancels a turn that was about to succeed and
leaves the session's `turn_status` reading `working`.

## Application State

- `navigation` describes the current view and selected entity ids. The default
  chat view is `chat` at `/home`; `/` is the public SSR marketing page.
- `navigate` moves the UI when the app supports it.
- `view-screen` is the first tool to call when the user's visible context
  matters.
- `provider-api-request` calls Slack through the shared workspace connection.
  Use `provider: "slack"` and an exact Web API path such as `/auth.test`.
  Missing access pauses the run and opens the contextual connection card; do
  not ask the user to paste credentials or replace the request with prose.

## Source Changes

Before building common workspace or agent UI, read `agent-native-toolkit`; read
`customizing-agent-native` before adapting shared UI.

- Guarded verification: run `pnpm agent-native:doctor`; fix findings before done.
